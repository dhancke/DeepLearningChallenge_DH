# DeepLearningChallenge_DH

Instructions

This activity involves helping a nonprofit foundation - Alphabet Soup - who wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding, with the best chance of success in their ventures. This task involves using machine learning and neural networks, applied to a dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded.

First steps involve preprocessing the data using Pandas and scikit-learn's StandardScaler. The second step will be using this data to compile, train and evaluate the nueural network model. 

The third step involves optimising the model using Tensorflow to acheive a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.


The final step is to write a report on the Neural Network Model and the performance of the deep learning model created, explaining the purpose of this analysis, including using bulleted lists and images to support answers, addressing the following questions:
Data Preprocessing
1. What variable(s) are the target(s) for the model?
2. What variable(s) are the features for the model?
3. What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions were select for the neural network model, and why?
2. Was the target model performance achieved?
3. What steps were taken to attempt to increase model performance?

Summary: Summarise the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
